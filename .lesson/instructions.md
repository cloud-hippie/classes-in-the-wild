# FourLeggedFriendFinder

Welcome to the Four Legged Friend Finder Simulation. A Lesson provided by Cloud Hippie.

Follow along in the official course.

## Introduction

We're going to help Christine build an application that allows interested users to adopt and save pets.

## Requriements Gathering

We have established our data model, data relationships and data presentation.

If you need a reference to these, see the official architecture doc:
- On the #four-legged-friend-finder channel on Discord
- Within the official Python lesson from Cloud Hippie.

## Simulation

We will need to write the Python code that reflects what we got from the requirements gathering.

  1. Navigate to the `main.py` file.
  2. Within the `main.py` file, you will see `class` definitions for `User`, `Pet` and `AdoptionApplication`.
  3. These are the `class`es we will be using to organize the data for our application.
  4. Navigate to the checkmark on the Left side of your browser. Click it and then Click the blue `Run Tests` button at the top of the new panel.
  5. In the `Console` on the right, you will see the results of the test suite running.
  6. Our first tests pass, but we want all of them to pass so we know our app does what we expect!

## Your Mission!

You got this! Read the failed tests to see what the current code fails to do.

Write your solution in the `code/main.py` file that get's the tests to pass.

Once you have completed the asignment:
- Fork this repo into your Github account.
- Take the URL.
- Submit the URL on the Assignment Page on Discord or your Cloud Hippie Classroom assignment lesson.
